## Requirements

To build and use this library, you need:
- A C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 9+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.21 or higher

---

## Installation

Schemer is header-only. Include `Schemer.h` (or an individual public header) and
link the CMake interface target `Schemer::Schemer` to inherit the Eigen
dependency and C++20 requirement; no Schemer library binary needs to be built
or distributed.

### Option 1: CMake `FetchContent` (Recommended)

Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
    Schemer
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Kacper-Jakubiak/Schemer.git
    GIT_TAG v1.0.0 # or a specific commit/branch
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(Schemer)

target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE Schemer::Schemer)

```

### Option 2: Manual / Submodule

1. Clone or add the repository as a submodule in your project's `vendor/` directory:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/Kacper-Jakubiak/Schemer.git vendor/Schemer
   ```
2. In your `CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   add_subdirectory(vendor/Schemer)
   target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE Schemer::Schemer)
   ```

---

## Quick Start

Here is a simple example of how to use the library:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {

}
```

## Building and Running Tests

To build the project along with its unit tests locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/Kacper-Jakubiak/Schemer.git](https://github.com/Kacper-Jakubiak/Schemer.git)
cd Schemer

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with tests enabled
cmake -DPROJECT_BUILD_TESTS=ON ..

# Build
cmake --build .

# Run tests (using CTest)
ctest --output-on-failure
```
